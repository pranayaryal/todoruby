This is a create, read, update and delete application using Ruby on Rails MVC framework. This was created using Test-driven development using rspec. It first makes you login or signup and then allows you to create your todolists.

It has a 'forgot password?' feature by which it sends a randomly generated token to your email to which can be clicked to make a new password.

It allows you to create, read, update and delete todolist items nested inside todo lists.

Twitter Bootstrap is used to make it look better.
